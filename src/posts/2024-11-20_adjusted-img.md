## CSS difficult to...

On my personal website, I've got my icon as the home screen image.
Since it's wrapped in an anchor tag for a link, there's this invisible link area around the image.

I've been trying to make the anchor and image the same size, but it's been a bit tricky.
For now, I've got it kind of working, but I want to try tweaking it again later.
