I don't know what I want to make anymore...

At work, I plan to use **Google Apps Script** to create a daily report management system.
For personal development, I would try to develop a desktop application.
I heard that Tauri recently upgraded to v2.
Rust is very tempting, I want to learn TypeScript now.
I have tried Tauri but never tried Electron.
So I would like to use it this time.

Electron is a proven framework such as **VS Code** .
Maybe it will be useful at work, I would like to give it a try.
