## Why

I recently migrated my personal website from SvelteKit to Lume.
Migrating the project execution environment from **Node.js** to **Deno** has simplified the project structure.
However, I am not good at CSS.
So I migrated my personal website to **VitePress**.
VitePress is already responsive by default. Very beautiful to look it.
By moving to VitePress, I will be able to concentrate on writing articles.

## What is VitePress?

[VitePress](https://vitepress.dev)

VitePress is a static site generator that allows you to manage content in Markdown.
I have been using Markdown to manage my content both in SvelteKit and in Lume.

VitePress is a project of Vue.
The layout customisation was written in Vue components.
I had never written Vue before and this is the first time I have written it.
I found it similar to the way Svelte writes. It is written like HTML.
I wrote Svelte so offen that I quickly got used to it.
However, this is the first time I have seen a syntax like `v-for`.
I decided that I would also study Vue.

## Migrated Deploy services

I have also migrated my personal website deployments from **Deno Deploy** to **Cloudflare Pages**.
Setting up the DNS records was easy as they were set up automatically.

I would also like to write many articles about VitePress.
