I post **Articles** and **Daily Report** on my blog.

Here is an explanation of what each one entails.

## Articles

I will write about what I have learned about programming.
I have tags set up for each article, but I can't search for tags yet.
My personal website was built with VitePress, which has a library called **MiniSearch** to search within the site.
Click on **"Search"** in the header and then search.

## Daily Report

I will write what I did that day.  
I write here about other contents besides programming.
Because the purpose of my personal website is "to learn English".
I am Japanese.
I can only read and write and speak Japanese.
But I want to learn English.
So I want to write a lot of Daily Report to learn English.  

If you see my Articles or Daily Report and find that I have written incorrect English,
please contact me via issue on GitHub.
