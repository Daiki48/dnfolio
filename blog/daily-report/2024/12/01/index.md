December started.

For me, 2024 was a very busy year.

We went on our haneymoon in the spring.
It was a good memory for me and my wife.
I will write a review of this year in another article.

Today, my wife and I went shopping again.
I was able to buy meat at a discount at a supermarket near my house.

I had developed a daily report management system in **Deno** , but decided to rewrite it in **Rust** .
In this diary, I wrote about why I chose Deno instead of Rust.
When I was writing that article, I wanted to write in Rust.
So I decided to study and develop in Rust.
