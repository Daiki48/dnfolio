## Why did I change my domain?

This site has been using the domain `https://dnfolio.dev` for a year.
Automatic renewal was scheduled to occur in February 2025.
Originally planned to post only on development,
but will now post on non-development topic.

## Renewal `dnfolio.dev` to `dnfolio.me`

I think the site further emphasizes the personal website.

## Changed Bluesky handle

I changed Bluesky handle name this way.
