Hi there! I'm Daiki Nakashima. I'm software engineer from Japan.
Coding is my passion, and I love doing it even when I'm not at work.

I also enjoy hitting the open road for a drive.

Traveling with my wife a few times a year is something I really look forward
to.
I feel truly fulfilled when I'm writing code.

## Experience

**Software Engineer** Kagoshima, Japan
Since June 2020

I am responsible for the operation and maintenance of our in-house SaaS product,
which is used by hundreds of companies nationwide.
I also create user guides for the product. Additionally, I am involved in the
development of a new product using Google Cloud Platform.

## Skills

- Programing language
  - TypeScript
    - I've been using TypeScript extensively in developing user guides with
      frameworks like **SvelteKit** and **VitePress**. I also utilized it for
      building this personal website using **Lume**.
  - Rust
    - I've been developing small CLI tools with Rust. It's a **unique language**
      that I find enjoyable to learn.
  - Go
    - I've had **limited exposure** to Go while working on application
      development on Google Cloud Platform.
- Framework
  - Sveltekit
    - I used Sveltekit to **develop static sites for user guides before
      transitioning to VitePress**. I also experimented with it for this
      personal website before settling on Lume.
  - VitePress
    - I'm currently using VitePress for **building user guides**.
  - Lume
    - I've **built this personal website** using Lume. However, I migrated my personal website [dnfolio](https://dnfolio.dev) from Lume to VitePress. Once I have mastered CSS, I would like to redesign my personal website from scratch.
