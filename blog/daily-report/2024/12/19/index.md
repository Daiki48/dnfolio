## Changing the Font in Obsidian

I noticed a discrepancy between the cursor display and the line height in the editing view.
After searching without finding a solution, I concluded that the issue was likely with the font I was using and decided to change it.

```json
{
  "interfaceFontFamily": "BIZ UDPゴシック,Sans Serif Collection,JetBrainsMono Nerd Font",
  "cssTheme": "",
  "textFontFamily": "BIZ UDPゴシック,Sans Serif Collection",
  "monospaceFontFamily": "JetBrainsMono Nerd Font Mono",
  "baseFontSize": 16,
  "accentColor": "#8e6533",
  "baseFontSizeAction": false,
  "showViewHeader": true
}
```

Originally, I had set `Sans Serif Collection` as the main font,
but it seems that there might be issues displaying multibyte characters like Japanese.
By changing it to `BIZ UDPゴシック` , the experience became incredibly comfortable.
