This site uses [Lume](https://lume.land) made by Deno.\
It was originally created in SvelteKit and published on Cloudflare pages.
However, I wanted to use the Deno services.

Also, I want to learn English. So I have changed the main language I use within
this site from Japanese to English.

## Architecture

- [Lume](https://lume.land)
- [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy)
- [Cloudflare Registrar](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/)
