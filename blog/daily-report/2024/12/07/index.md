## I organized my Neovim environment

The end of the year is approaching.
I have used `coc.nvim` a lot this year in the development of Neovim.
Next year I would like to use the Neovim built in LSP using `nvim-lspconfig` .

I use Neovim, so I considered using `nvim-cmp` as a complementary plugin.
Before using `coc.nvim`, I use `ddc.vim`.
However, I would prefer to write the entire setup in **Lua** .
I have decided to use `blink.cmp`.
The details of the setup will be summarized in a separate article.

## I hadn't seen my nephew in a long time

I saw my nephew for the first time in two months.
He is a very energetic child.
I will be playing with my nephew tomorrow as well. I am looking forward to it.
